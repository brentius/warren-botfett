# WARREN BOTFETT

A systematic, event-driven algorithmic trading bot designed to run on a Raspberry Pi 5. Combines multi-strategy signal generation, layered risk management, and remote control via Discord — all within a modular architecture built for reliability over uptime-sensitive hardware.

---

## Overview

This bot is not a latency-arbitrage machine. It is a strategy-driven system that generates signals from technical and (optionally) ML-based analysis, passes them through a risk layer, and executes via a broker abstraction — with full monitoring, structured logging, and a Discord command interface for remote control.

It is designed to run headlessly on a Pi 5, survive reboots, and be observable and controllable entirely from your phone.

## Pipeline

Data flows in one direction through clearly separated layers. Each layer has a single responsibility and communicates via well-defined interfaces.

## Discord Remote Control

The bot is controllable via a Discord bot running as a separate systemd service. All commands are restricted to a whitelist of Discord user IDs defined in `settings.py`.

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `!status` | Current positions, P&L, open orders, bot health |
| `!halt` | Triggers the circuit breaker — stops all activity |
| `!pause` | Stops new signals; holds existing positions |
| `!resume` | Resumes signal generation after a pause |
| `!positions` | Detailed breakdown of current holdings |
| `!metrics` | Session Sharpe, drawdown, win rate |
| `!logs [n]` | Tail the last n log lines |
| `!setparam [strategy] [key] [value]` | Adjust a strategy parameter live |

`!halt` and `!pause` route through the same circuit breaker path as `stop_loss.py` — they never bypass the risk layer.

---

## Prerequisites

- Raspberry Pi 5 (4GB RAM minimum recommended)
- Python 3.11+
- Redis (optional — falls back to in-memory cache)
- A supported broker account (Alpaca recommended for getting started)
- A Discord bot token and server

---

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/yourname/trading-bot.git
cd trading-bot

# Create and activate a virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Copy the example env file and fill in your secrets
cp .env.example .env
nano .env
```

---

## Configuration

All configuration lives in `config/`. You should not need to touch application code to adjust trading behaviour.

**`config/settings.py`** — broker credentials (loaded from `.env`), timeouts, log rotation policy, max position size, drawdown limit, Discord allowlist.

**`config/stocks.yaml`** — your watchlist and any per-symbol parameter overrides.

**`config/strategies.yaml`** — indicator lookback windows, signal thresholds, and strategy weights used by `generator.py`.

---

## Running

### Development (foreground)

```bash
python main.py
```

### Production (systemd — recommended for Pi)

Two services run independently: the main trading loop and the Discord bot. This ensures Discord control remains available even if the trading loop crashes.

```bash
# Copy service files
sudo cp deploy/trading-bot.service /etc/systemd/system/
sudo cp deploy/discord-bot.service /etc/systemd/system/

# Enable and start
sudo systemctl enable trading-bot discord-bot
sudo systemctl start trading-bot discord-bot

# Check status
sudo systemctl status trading-bot
sudo journalctl -u trading-bot -f
```

---

## Backtesting

The backtest engine uses the exact same strategy, signal, and risk code as the live system — no separate implementations. To run a backtest:

```bash
python -m backtesting.engine \
  --symbols AAPL MSFT \
  --start 2023-01-01 \
  --end 2024-01-01 \
  --strategy momentum
```

Output is a performance report in `reports/` containing an equity curve, drawdown chart, trade-by-trade log, and summary statistics. The metrics schema matches `monitoring/metrics.py` so you can compare backtest expectations directly against live session results.

---

## Monitoring

Logs are structured JSON written to `logs/` and rotated daily (7-day retention by default — conserve SD card space on Pi). Each log entry includes timestamp, module, event type, symbol, and a payload dict.

Key metrics tracked live by `metrics.py`:

- Session and cumulative P&L
- Sharpe ratio (rolling)
- Maximum drawdown
- Win rate and average win/loss ratio
- Order rejection rate
- Execution slippage (expected vs actual fill)

Alerts fire via Discord when any configured threshold is breached. Alert thresholds are set in `settings.py`.

---

## Raspberry Pi Notes

The Pi 5 is capable hardware for this workload, but a few things deserve attention:

**Thermal management.** Sustained CPU load during market hours will cause throttling without adequate cooling. A heatsink + fan case is strongly recommended. The bot logs Pi CPU temperature via `alerts.py` and fires an alert above the configured threshold.

**Power loss.** `order_manager.py` persists state to disk and reconciles against the broker's actual open orders on startup. A clean shutdown hook is registered in `main.py`. An uninterruptible power supply (UPS HAT) is recommended for live trading.

**Storage.** Use a quality A2-rated SD card or, preferably, boot from USB SSD. SD cards under continuous write load fail. Log rotation is aggressive by default to limit writes.

**Dependencies.** Keep the live trading path dependency-light. Do not import PyTorch or heavy ML libraries in the main loop — use ONNX Runtime for inference if `ml_model.py` is active.

---

## Safety

- **Never commit `.env`** — it is in `.gitignore` by default.
- The Discord command allowlist in `settings.py` is the only authentication layer for remote commands. Keep it to your own user ID.
- `!halt` is the emergency stop. Know the command before you go live.
- Paper trade for a meaningful period before deploying real capital. The systemd setup supports a `paper=true` flag in `.env` that routes all orders to broker paper trading endpoints.

---

## Development

```bash
# Run tests
pytest tests/

# Lint
ruff check .

# Type check
mypy .
```

New strategies must implement the interface defined in `strategies/base.py`. They receive an aligned OHLCV DataFrame and a config dict, and return a `Signal` object. They must be stateless — given the same inputs, they must always return the same output.
